    - resizable, zoom-able display
    - assigning expression levels to **low**, **medium**, **high**
- Examples:
    - [Foxo3 (mouse)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/genes/ENSMUSG00000048756)
    - [Respiratory gaseous exchange](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/genesets/GO:0007585)

#### New feature: similar expression patterns

- This release includes a new feature for exploring genes with similar expression patterns across conditions in baseline experiments. Explore examples:
    - In [_Vitis vinifera_ development](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4220?accessKey=&serializedFilterFactors=&queryFactorType=DEVELOPMENTAL_STAGE&rootContext=&heatmapMatrixSize=50&displayLevels=false&displayGeneDistribution=false&geneQuery=VIT_01s0010g00060&_queryFactorValues=1&specific=true&_specific=on&cutoff=0.5)
    - In [_Oryza sativa_ tissues](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-2037?accessKey=&serializedFilterFactors=&queryFactorType=ORGANISM_PART&rootContext=&heatmapMatrixSize=50&displayLevels=false&displayGeneDistribution=false&geneQuery=EPlOSAG00000008047&_queryFactorValues=1&specific=true&_specific=on&cutoff=0.5)

#### New experiments

- This release of Expression Atlas includes datasets on **tomato** (_Solanum lycopersicum_), a new species for us! We now have **four baseline experiments**, studying fruit development and profiling various tissues:
    - [Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of the five principal tissues of the pericarp from tomato fruits at their maximal growth phase](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4765)
    - [Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of tomato root, leaf, flower (2 stages) and fruit (6 stages)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4812)
    - [Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing along three longitudinal sections of six stages during tomato fruit development](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4813)
    - [Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of tomato fruit at four developmental stages](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4818)

- As well as the above baseline datasets, we can also showcase **seven differential expression studies** on tomato:
    - [Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of tomato Rio Grande prf3 leaves challenged with either the flgII-28 peptide or different bacterial strains](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4789)
    - [Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of two tomato nearly isogenic lines that differ for the allele at fw3.2 in Yellow Stuffer background](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4792)
    - [Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of flower buds from two tomato nearly isogenic lines that differ for the allele at fw3.2 in Yellow Stuffer background](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4793)
    - [Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of leaves of resistant (RG-PtoR) and susceptible (RG-prf3 and RG-prf19) tomato plants treated with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato str. DC3000](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4796)
    - [Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of leaves of resistant (RG-PtoR) tomato plants treated with different Pst DC3000 mutant strains](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4797)
    - [Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of immature green and red ripe tomato fruits from plants over-expressing SIGLK1 and SIGLK2](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4819)
    - [Transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing of tomato SUN and wild type fruit tissues](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4837)

- The latest release also sees our first experiment studying baseline expression in different [Arabidopsis tissues](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-GEOD-38612), a [new dataset on tonsil](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4754) from the [BLUEPRINT Epigenome project](http://dcc.blueprint-epigenome.eu/) as well as updates to the previously-added BLUEPRINT [dataset on haematopoiesis](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-3827), and [RNA-seq data](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4729) from [Open Targets](http://www.opentargets.org/) showing baseline expression of lung disease cell line models.

#### Bioconductor package out now
