#### Software features

### New marker genes calculation integrated into web display
The new calculation method to detect marker genes for each condition/experimental group within a baseline experiment (first introduced in the previous release) have now been integrated into the experiment page web diplay, e.g. [RNA-seq of coding RNA from seven Bos taurus tissues](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-2596/Results) The gene expression heatmap now uses the *Marker Genes* display as the default view for all baseline experiments, users can toggle between the display options by (de)selecting the *Marker Genes* checkbox. The full list of marker genes identified for a particular experiment can also be downloaded via our [FTP](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/data/atlas/experiments/).
