#### Software features

### Marker genes on Heatmap
We have now integrated the marker genes (first introduced in release #42) into our webapp for baseline experiments. The marker genes can be toggled in webapp using *Marker Gene* checkbox, which is checked by default when an experiment is loaded. Marker genes are also available for download via our FTP. For more details, see our FAQ sections: ‘Can I get marker genes for the different experimental groups?’ and ’How are the marker genes for individual experimental groups calculated?’
