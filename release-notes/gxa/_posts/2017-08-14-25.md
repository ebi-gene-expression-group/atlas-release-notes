#### Data statistics

- Ensembl **89** / Ensembl Genomes **36** / WormBase ParaSite **9** gene annotations and array design probe set mappings.
- This release contains **3,126** datasets (**113,148** assays), in particular:
    - **537** RNA-seq and **4** proteomics datasets, of which **131** report [baseline](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/baseline/experiments) gene expression, across a total of **32** different organisms;
    - **731** datasets reporting expression in [plants](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments);
    - **2,998** datasets studying samples in **8,391** [differential](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/index.html#differential-expression) comparisons across **33** different organisms.

#### New experiments

- First pig baseline RNA-seq data (_Sus scrofa_):
    - [RNA-seq of different tissues from Sus scrofa](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-5895)

#### New features

- All RNA-Seq baseline experiments are displayed using TPMs by default where available. There is a new radio button to switch to FPKMs if desired.
    - Example: [Open Targets RNA-seq analysis of six cell lines in TPM](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4101/Results) cf. [the same experiment in FPKM](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4101/Results?unit=%2522FPKM%2522).

- You can download results from the Gene Set Enrichment results page by clicking on the _Download results_ button on the top right.
- Now you can choose what data to download in the experiment page: the highest expressed genes as displayed in the heatmap, or all results matching your query.
    - Example: click on the down-pointing arrow in the _Download_ button, located to the right above the heatmap, to download e.g. [all genes with expression level above 10 TPM in _Illumina Body Map_, _Download all data_ or only the top 50 genes sorted by expression level](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-513/Results?specific=true&geneQuery=%255B%255D&filterFactors=%257B%257D&cutoff=%257B%2522value%2522%253A10%257D&unit=%2522TPM%2522), _Download table content_.
