#### Data statistics

- Ensembl **83** / Ensembl Genomes **29** gene annotations and array design probe set mappings.
- This release contains **2,574** datasets (**98,278** assays), in particular:
    - **157** RNA-seq and **1** proteomics dataset, of which **46** report [baseline](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/baseline/experiments) gene expression, across a total of **19** different organisms;
    - **568** datasets reporting expression in [plants](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments);
    - **2,527** datasets studying samples in **7,119** [differential](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/index.html#differential-expression) comparisons across **26** different organisms.

- This release launches the **new gene and gene-set interface**, available for species-specific gene queries or gene-set identifier queries, via Gene Ontology (GO) or Reactome IDs, e.g.
    - [Foxo3 (mouse)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/genes/ENSMUSG00000048756)
    - [Respiratory gaseous exchange](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/genesets/GO:0007585)

- The new pages feature faceted search in _Differential expression_ and _Baseline Expression_ tabs, including
     - **Filtering differential expression** by Species, Experiment, Variables, up or down regulation etc.
     - Ability to **show/hide baseline experiments** studying other conditions than just tissues, e.g. cell lines, cell types, etc.
     - **Anatomograms can now be shown/hidden** as required.

 Baseline experiment types, except for cell lines, can be viewed on a heatmap.
