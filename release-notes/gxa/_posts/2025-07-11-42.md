### Highlights

#### New species
- A new species has been added to the Bulk Expression Atlas: ***Dictyostelium discoideum***, the first protist included. The study features [RNA-Seq data of terminal differentiated cells](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-7215)

#### New plant datasets
- Total of 12 new plant datasets from sorghum, rice, _Arabidopsis_ and maize have been added in this release, e.g [Variation in gene expression between two Sorghum bicolor lines differing in innate immunity response](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-GEOD-151860) or [RNA-seq samples of ten tissues for each of the 25 genomes of the Nested Associated Mapping (NAM) maize sequencing project](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-8633/)

#### New analysis in the European Diagnostic Transcriptomic Library (EDTL) collection
- Additional gene expression analysis [Diagnosis of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) by a whole-blood transcriptional signature - differential analysis](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-CURD-149) has been performed for data from the [European Diagnostic Transcriptomic Library (EDTL)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/edtl/experiments) collection

#### New analysis data files available for download
- We have implemented a new pipeline to identify marker genes for each experimental group in baseline experiments. The analysis results are now downloadable via our [FTP](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/data/atlas/experiments/) and will be included and visualised directly on the experiment pages in a future release. You can find more information about this data in our [FAQ](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/FAQ.html) under the section 'Can I get marker genes for the different experimental groups?'
