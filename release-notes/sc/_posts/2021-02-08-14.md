This is a software release only, so no new datasets have been added or updated

#### New features
- New interactive organ anatomograms for lung, pancreas, ... allow users to explore expression in cell types as they look into different organism parts and cell scaffolds. N experiments in SC Expression Atlas include anatomograms.
  - Dataset example 1 for lung
  - Dataset example 2 for pancreas
  - ..
- Organ anatomograms are accompanied by interactive cell type heatmaps, which react to selections in the anatomogram to display average cell type expression for marker genes.
- tSNE plot by default colours cells by inferred cell type, if available.
- tSNE plot and expression heatmaps can be exported as images, regardless of the size.
- Datasets have links to GEO/ENA
