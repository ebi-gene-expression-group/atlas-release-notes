This is a software release only, so no new datasets have been added or updated

#### New features
- Cell type anatomograms for lung, pancreas, ... allow users to explore expression in cell types as they look into different organism parts and cell scaffolds.
- Cell type anatomograms are accompanied by cell type heatmaps, which react to selections in the anatomogram to display average cell type expression for marker genes.
- tSNE plot by default colours cells by inferred cell type, if available.
