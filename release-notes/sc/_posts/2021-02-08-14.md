This is a software release only, so no new datasets have been added or updated

#### New features
- New interactive organ anatomograms for kidney, liver, lung, pancreas and placenta allow users to explore expression in cell types as they look into different organism parts and cell scaffolds within this organs. Approximately 11 experiments in Single Cell Expression Atlas, that have the required level of annotation, include anatomograms. Some examples below:
  - [Lung Cell Atlas: Single cell RNA sequencing analysis of fresh resected human lung tissue](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-130148/results/anatomogram)
  - [Dissecting the human liver cellular landscape by single cell RNA-seq reveals novel intrahepatic monocyte/macrophage populations](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-9/results/anatomogram)
  - [Single cell transcriptomics defines human islet cell signatures and reveals cell-type-specific expression changes in type 2 diabetes](http://wp-p2m-8e:8080/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-27/results/anatomogram)
- Organ anatomograms are accompanied by interactive cell type heatmaps, which react to selections in the anatomogram to display average cell type expression for marker genes.
- tSNE plot by default colours cells by inferred cell type, if available.
- tSNE plot and expression heatmaps can be exported as images, regardless of the size.
- Datasets have links to GEO/ENA
