#### Data statistics
- Ensembl **99** / Ensembl Genomes **46** / WormBase ParaSite **14** gene annotations.   
- This release contains **172** single cell RNA-Seq studies, consisting of **5,053,431** cells, of which **3,523,470** passed our QC from **14** different species.
- The aim of this release was to deliver updates in our [analysis pipeline](https://github.com/ebi-gene-expression-group/scxa-workflows), performance improvements and inclusion of experiments collections for display.

#### New features
- In the experiment page, Supplementary Information tab, a section called Resources is available now for external resource links. These are resources potentially from ArrayExpress, GEO, ENA and EGA.
- A bug was fixed to allow users to download images for large tSNE plots, e.g.[E-HCAD-14](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-HCAD-14)
- Marker Gene Heatmap: The marker gene symbols/IDs shown as row labels now act as hyperlinks, linking to the gene search result page within Single Cell Expression Atlas.
- In the Browse Experiments page, after checking the box to download the experiment and clicking the download link, a pop-up window now lets you select the file types (raw quantification, normalised counts or experimental design) to download.
