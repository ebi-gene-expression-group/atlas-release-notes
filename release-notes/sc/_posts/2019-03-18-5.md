#### Data statistics
- Ensembl **95** / Ensembl Genomes **42** / WormBase ParaSite **12** gene annotations.   
- This release contains **52** single cell RNA-Seq studies, consisting of **61,073** cells, of which **38,159** passed
  our QC from **9** different species.

#### New experiments
- [Transcriptomic profiling of antigen-specific T cells at the single-cell level after clearance of hepatitis C virus (Human)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-4850)

#### New features
- A marker gene heatmap which displays the top 5 marker genes (sorted by p-value) grouped by cluster is available in all experiments. For instance, have a look at the heatmap in:
  - [Melanoma infiltration of stromal and immune cells ](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-EHCA-2/results/marker-genes)
  - [Single cell transcriptomics of mixed asexual and sexual blood stage parasites of the rodent malaria model *Plasmodium berghei*](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ENAD-16/results/marker-genes)
- Tabular search results with cleaner, easier-to-discriminate, experiment details. Check out any of the following
