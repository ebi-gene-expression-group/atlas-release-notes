#### Software features
- **Gut anatomogram** - a new human anatomogram for the large and small intestines has been added in this release and accompanies eligible experiments e.g. [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-125970/results/anatomogram)
- **Inferred cell type marker gene heatmap** - for experiments where inferred cell type data is available you can now view marker genes based on the inferred cell type clusters e.g. [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-227038/results/marker-genes)

#### New experiments
Highlights
- **Externally analysed data** - for the first time in this release we have included a new class of data to Single Cell Expression Atlas - externally analysed data, marked with an 'E' icon. 
  These are currently limited to a careful selection of eligible high-impact human datasets including the [GTEx: snRNAseq atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-ANND-2) As these    experiments are not re-analysed with our own analysis pipelines, not all the standard chart or data options may be available
- [Aging Fly Cell Atlas Identifies Exhaustive Aging Features at Cellular Resolution](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-218661)
- [The human gastrointestinal tract through space and time - Adult GEX](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-MTAB-9543)
