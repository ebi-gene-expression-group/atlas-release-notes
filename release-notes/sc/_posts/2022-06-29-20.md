#### Data statistics

- Ensembl **104** / Ensembl Genomes **51** / WormBase ParaSite **15** gene annotations.   
- This is a software release only, no additional data has been included.

#### New features

- Now cell types, organism parts and conditions (among other metadata fields) can be searched as well, in addition to the previous gene search.
- Cell types, organism parts and condition search have their results displayed in an interactive cell type wheel accompanied by a gene vs cell type heatmap.
- Visualistion improvements in the cell plots (which leads to annotated cells being more prominently visible above cells without annotation).
- Download page improvements.
- Ontology annotation updates for placenta, liver and lung anatomograms.
