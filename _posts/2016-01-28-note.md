#### Data statistics

- Ensembl **83** / Ensembl Genomes **30** gene annotations and array design probe set mappings.          
- This release contains **2,620** datasets (**97,484** assays), in particular:       
    - **167** RNA-seq and **1** proteomics dataset, of which **47** report [baseline](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/baseline/experiments) gene expression, across a total of **19** different organisms;            
    - **582** datasets reporting expression in [plants](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments);           
    - **2,573** datasets studying samples in **7,281** [differential](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/index.html#differential-expression) comparisons across **29** different organisms.
- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) experiment summary objects for RNA-seq datasets now use
                    the new _RangedSummarizedExperiment_ class from the [Summarized Experiment](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html) [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) package. See the [help page](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/r-data-objects.html) for more details about how to use them.
