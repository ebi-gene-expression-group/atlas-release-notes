    - **2,992** datasets studying samples in **8,368** [differential](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/index.html#differential-expression) comparisons across **33** different organisms.

#### New experiments

- New baseline RNA-seq data from the [Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HipSci)](http://www.hipsci.org/):
    - [RNA-seq of coding RNA in human fibroblasts, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) ](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4748)

- Updated version of Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project with 18,736 assays:
    - [RNA-seq from 52 human tissue samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-5214)

#### New Home Page

- We have updated our [home page](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa) with more useful links to species-specific experiments or other large scale projects.

#### On-the-fly gene set overlap analysis

- Our [GeneSet Enrichment API](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~rpetry/geteam/gsa/gsa_apispec.pdf) now has a front page. Click on "Gene Set Enrichment" next to "Search" on our [home page](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa) and input a set of gene identifiers.
    - Example result: [ Arabidopsis thaliana](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/genesetenrichment?query=AT1G48030%20AT1G53240%20AT2G17130%20AT2G20420%20AT2G44350%20AT2G47510%20AT3G09810%20AT3G15020%20AT3G17240%20AT3G27380%20AT3G55410%20AT3G60100%20AT4G26910%20AT4G35260%20AT4G35650%20AT4G35830%20AT5G03290%20AT5G08300%20AT5G23250%20AT5G40650%20AT5G50950%20AT5G55070%20AT5G65165%20AT5G65750%20AT5G66760)

#### New Experiment Page

- Our experiment pages have been re-organised and updated with a new style of heatmap. See [help pages](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/index.html) for more details while exploring an example:
