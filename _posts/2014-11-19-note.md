#### Data statistics

- Ensembl **77** / Ensembl Genomes **24** gene annotations and array design probe set mappings.
- This release contains **844** datasets, including **50** RNA-seq experiments. **22** of these report [baseline](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/baseline/experiments) gene expression, across a total of **16** different organisms. **822** datasets study samples in **2,032** [differential](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/index.html#differential-expression) comparisons across **20** different organisms.
- Plant experiments, for example [our first RNA-seq maize data set](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-3028), now allow users to display expression in the [![Gramene](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/resources/images/release-notes/gramene-small.png) Genome Browser](http://ensembl.gramene.org/genome_browser/index.html).
