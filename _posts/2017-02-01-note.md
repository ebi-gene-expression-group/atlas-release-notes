#### Data statistics

- Ensembl **87** / Ensembl Genomes **34** gene annotations and array design probe set mappings.
- This release contains **3,063** datasets (**125,327** assays), in particular:
    - **494** RNA-seq and **3** proteomics datasets, of which **122** report [baseline](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/baseline/experiments) gene expression, across a total of **30** different organisms;
    - **703** datasets reporting expression in [plants](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments);
    - **2,941** datasets studying samples in **8,246** [differential](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/index.html#differential-expression) comparisons across **33** different organisms.

#### New experiments

- New mouse embryo data from the Mouse Genetics Project/[DMDD](http://dmdd.org.uk) project:
    - [Strand-specific RNA-seq of somite-staged whole embryos comparing 11 homozygous mutants against wild type](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-5224)

- New human baseline expression on prenatal brain tissues from the Human Developmental Biology Resource [HDBR](http://www.hdbr.org):
    - [RNA-seq from 23 time points and 21 different embryonic brain tissues](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-4840)

#### New Features

- Data on cross-experiment, organism part heatmaps can now be **filtered** by **anatomical systems** and **gene expression**. Explore example:
