#### Data statistics

- Ensembl **76** / Ensembl Genomes **23** gene annotations and array design probe set mappings;
- **709** experiments, including **39** RNA-seq experiments (**13**[baseline](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/baseline/experiments), **26** differential), studying samples in **1,684** differential comparisons and **24** organisms (see below for breakdown of comparisons per organism);
- All Human RNA-seq experiments have been re-analysed against the new assembly (GRCh38), e.g. [RNA-seq of coding RNA from tissue samples of 95 human individuals representing 27 different tissues](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-1733);
- Baseline expression levels available for genes and transcripts in 75 tissues, 21 cell lines, 7 cellular components, 39 developmental stages and 3 RNA types;
- Quality control reports, e.g. [FASTQ QC](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-1733/fastqc/homo%20sapiens/qc.html) and [Mapping](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-1733/fastqc/homo%20sapiens/mapping/tophat2.html), are now available for all RNA-seq experiments;
- [EFO](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/)-based autocomplete for experimental conditions is now available on the main Atlas search page. Please see 'How to search' section of [Atlas help page](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/index.html) for more details. [The main search interface](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/) also now allows users to restrict search to a single organism;
- User queries in the main Atlas search interface are expanded using the latest [EFO](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/). This means that if you search for e.g. "cancer", you will also see results with terms such as "carcinoma", "malignant tumour", and other synonyms and children of the [cancer](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0000311) entry in EFO;
- Gene set overlap analysis is performed using the Piano package from Bioconductor. In each differential experiment, for each comparison, enrichment of terms from GO, InterPro, and Reactome is tested for within the set of differentially expressed genes, using Fisher's exact test. Plots showing maximum top ten GO, Interpro and Reactome terms enriched within the differentially expressed genes for each comparison are now available for each differential experiment in Atlas. Please see [Differential Atlas help](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/index.html#differential-experiment-plots) for more information.
- For [differential expression](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/index.html#differential-expression) experiments you can now download a file containing the expression data and meta-data that you can load into [R](http://www.r-project.org/). Please see [Expression Atlas data in R help](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/r-data-objects.html) for more information;
- Differential and Baseline Expression can now be visualised on Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes Genome Browser. Please see [“Can I view the results in the Ensembl browser?” in our FAQ](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/FAQ.html#ensembl) for more information.
