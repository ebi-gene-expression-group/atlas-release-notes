#### New features

- Improved search with special characters. You can now search for conditions like [2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/search?geneQuery=%5B%5D&organism=&conditionQuery=%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%222-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4%2C4%2C5%2C5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide%22%7D%5D).
