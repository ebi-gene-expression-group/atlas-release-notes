#### Data statistics

- Ensembl **85** / Ensembl Genomes **32** gene annotations and array design probe set mappings.
- This release contains **2,968** datasets (**110,249** assays), in particular:
    - **444** RNA-seq and **2** proteomics datasets, of which **108** report [baseline](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/baseline/experiments) gene expression, across a total of **25** different organisms;
    - **632** datasets reporting expression in [plants](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments);
    - **2,860** datasets studying samples in **8,015** [differential](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/index.html#differential-expression) comparisons across **30** different organisms.

#### New Features

- Data on heatmaps can now be **sorted** by **gene** and **protein expression rank**. Explore example:
