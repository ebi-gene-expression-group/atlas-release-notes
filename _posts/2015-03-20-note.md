#### Data statistics

- Ensembl **79** / Ensembl Genomes **25** gene annotations and array design probe set mappings.
- This release contains **932** datasets, including:
    - **56** RNA-seq, of which **26** of these report [baseline](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/baseline/experiments) gene expression, across a total of **16** different organisms;
    - **258** reporting expression in [plants](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments);
    - **906** studying samples in **2,291** [differential](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/index.html#differential-expression) comparisons across **20** different organisms.
- New data sets of note:
    - [RNA-seq of 39 human cancer cell lines that are in the NCI-60 set from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-2980)
    - [RNA-Seq CAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression) analysis of human tissues in RIKEN FANTOM5 project](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-3358)
- Differential expression for RNA-seq data is now calculated using [**DESeq2**](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) method.
- Users searching for a single gene within a baseline experiment are now able to see how expression varies across biological replicates for each condition - by selecting **Display variation** option. This is currently a prototype - we welcome any feedback you may have. Please use the feedback button on the top right hand side of all Atlas pages.
